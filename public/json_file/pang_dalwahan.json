        "executive_summary": "This demo evaluated Leads Agri's ISMART NAND UREA as a foliar biostimulant on rice (NSIC R. 534) at Michael D. Ranges' farm in PI, Dirita, Iba, Zambales, with application on April 4, 2025. The product was applied at 50ml foliar at 31 DAT. Performance was assessed against an untreated control focusing on tillering and Leaf Color Chart (LCC) ratings. ISMART NAND UREA demonstrated a moderate but consistent improvement in key physiological parameters. The treated plot averaged 19 tillers compared to 17.5 for the control (an absolute difference of 1.5 tillers, representing an 8.57% increase) across 10 and 18 DAA assessments. Furthermore, the product maintained superior leaf greenness, achieving an average LCC rating of 4.0 versus the control's 3.5 (a 0.5-point increase, or 14.29% higher rating than control), with the control's greenness declining by 18 DAA while the treated remained stable. These improvements were visible within 10-18 days post-application. \n\nThe cooperator provided positive feedback, noting 'more tillers' by 10 DAA and 'greener leaves' by 18 DAA, aligning with the measured data. However, critical yield data and commercial demo metrics (participants, sales) are currently unavailable, limiting the assessment of economic impact and market potential. While the physiological benefits are encouraging, the absence of yield data and commercial engagement represents a significant risk. The primary opportunity lies in quantifying these benefits through yield measurement and conducting a full-scale demo showcase. Confidence in the physiological efficacy is medium due to limited data points, but the clear positive trend and cooperator feedback are strong indicators. It is highly recommended to prioritize completing the yield assessment and organizing a comprehensive product demo to validate the economic value and drive market adoption, ensuring the full potential of ISMART NAND UREA is realized."

A line chart effectively visualizes the sustained LCC trend over time, contrasting it with the control's decline. Bar charts compare average LCC ratings and tiller counts, providing clear quantitative differences. A gauge chart emphasizes the relative improvement in LCC, making the percentage gain immediately apparent. These charts collectively underscore the product's positive effects, aligning with cooperator feedback, despite the absence of critical yield data."

        "executive_summary": "This demo report for Ismart Nano Urea, a fertilizer product, was conducted on rice in Banlugan Sitio Oligan Pozorrubio, Pangasinan, with an application date of June 19, 2025. While the Crop Vigor for Leads Agri was rated '2' at 7 DAA, the control was recorded as 'T' (typical/untreated), making direct numerical comparison and statistical assessment impossible due to the qualitative nature of the control data and an unspecified rating scale. Crucially, yield data was not measured, and there was no assessment at 14 DAA. However, the cooperator provided highly positive feedback, stating the product was 'Maganda' (good/effective) and that visible results were observed within a rapid timeframe of 5 days post-application, indicating a fast-acting effect. This qualitative validation is a significant highlight, despite the limitations in quantitative data. \n\nDespite the promising qualitative feedback and rapid visible results, the trial is significantly hampered by the lack of quantifiable efficacy data (yield, comparable vigor metrics) and missing application protocol details (rates, methods, timings). These data gaps pose a high risk to scientific validation and scalability. The trial's limited scope (single cooperator/plot) also restricts generalizability. Conversely, the strong positive cooperator sentiment and the product's fast action present clear opportunities for market entry and initial farmer adoption. The overall confidence level in quantifiable performance is low, but the qualitative validation is strong. Therefore, a high-priority recommendation is to immediately conduct follow-up efficacy trials with standardized, quantifiable metrics and complete protocols to substantiate claims, define optimal application strategies, and provide robust evidence for product value proposition."

Therefore, the charting strategy focuses on two critical areas: first, highlighting the overall low quality and completeness of the trial data (44% completeness score) to inform future data collection efforts. Second, it emphasizes the strong positive qualitative feedback from the cooperator, which is the most compelling finding from this demo, noting the product's perceived effectiveness and rapid visible results within 5 days."
