          "executive_summary": "This demo trial evaluated the efficacy of Frontier 200 OD, a herbicide product, on rice in Los Banos, Laguna during the dry season, with application on February 3, 2025. The trial demonstrated that Leads Agri's Frontier 200 OD achieved superior weed control compared to the Farmer's Practice (FP). Averaging across 3, 7, and 14 Days After Application (DAA), Leads Agri secured an average weed control rating of 3.67, significantly outperforming the FP's consistent average of 3.0. This represents a 0.67-point increase in control, equating to a 16.75% improvement relative to the 1-4 rating scale, where 4 signifies 'Excellent' control. Frontier 200 OD exhibited a moderate speed of action, showing initial 'Acceptable' control at 3 DAA, rapidly progressing to 'Excellent' control by 7 DAA, and maintaining this high level of efficacy through the 14 DAA assessment. In contrast, the Farmer's Practice remained at an 'Acceptable' control level throughout the observation period. While the quantitative results indicate a strong performance, the absence of cooperator feedback and yield data presents a limitation, precluding a comprehensive validation of farmer satisfaction and economic impact. Key opportunities lie in the product's demonstrated ability to achieve excellent and sustained weed control shortly after application. However, risks include the demo's single-location, single-plot design, and the lack of critical yield and qualitative feedback. To fully capitalize on Frontier 200 OD's potential, a high-priority recommendation is to conduct further trials focusing on collecting yield data and structured cooperator feedback across diverse locations to solidify its market value proposition and broaden its applicability."
