The trial demonstrated compelling improvements in key crop vigor metrics. Leads Agri significantly enhanced tillering, resulting in an average of 19.0 tillers per plant compared to 17.5 for the untreated control, an absolute difference of 1.5 tillers and an 8.57% relative improvement. This moderate to significant increase in tillering was observed as early as 10 DAA. Furthermore, the product maintained superior leaf color, achieving an average LCC rating of 4.0, while the control declined to 3.5, representing a 0.5-point absolute difference and a 14.29% higher rating. This indicates Leads Agri's efficacy in sustaining optimal crop health, particularly in preventing the decline in greenness seen in the control group by 18 DAA. \n\nThe cooperator feedback strongly aligns with these quantitative findings, highlighting 'more tillers' by 10 DAA and 'greener leaves' by 18 DAA, indicating rapid and visible results. While the absence of yield data is a critical limitation to a full economic assessment, the strong performance in vegetative parameters and positive farmer sentiment present significant opportunities for market penetration. Key risks include the vague details of the farmer's practice baseline. Overall, ISMART NANO UREA shows promising potential as a crop enhancer, warranting high-priority follow-up trials to quantify its impact on final yield and solidify its value proposition."

A doughnut chart visualizes the cooperator's positive sentiment, reinforcing the observed benefits. These charts collectively illustrate the product's ability to enhance crop vigor and are crucial for understanding its potential value to farmers, despite the absence of yield data."
